'It's the oldest rule in the book,' said the King.
'It's the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,' said the Queen.
'It's--it's a very fine day!' said a timid voice at her side. She was
'Just about as much right,' said the Duchess, 'as pigs have to fly; and
'Keep your temper,' said the Caterpillar.
'Leave off that!' screamed the Queen. 'You make me giddy.' And then,
'Let the jury consider their verdict,' the King said, for about the

'May it please your Majesty,' said Two, in a very humble tone, going
'Mine is a long and a sad tale!' said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and
'My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,' said Alice very politely;
'Nearly two miles high,' added the Queen.
'Never mind!' said the King, with an air of great relief. 'Call the next
'Never!' said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard
'No, I didn't,' said Alice: 'I don't think it's at all a pity. I said
'No, I give it up,' Alice replied: 'what's the answer?'
'No, indeed,' said Alice. 'What sort of a dance is it?'
'No, no! The adventures first,' said the Gryphon in an impatient tone:
'No, no!' said the Queen. 'Sentence first--verdict afterwards.'
'No, please go on!' Alice said very humbly; 'I won't interrupt again. I
'No, they're not,' said the White Rabbit, 'and that's the queerest thing
'No,' said Alice. 'I don't even know what a Mock Turtle is.'
'No,' said the Caterpillar.
'Nobody asked YOUR opinion,' said Alice.
'Nonsense!' said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was
'Nor I,' said the March Hare.
'Not I!' said the Lory hastily.
'Not QUITE right, I'm afraid,' said Alice, timidly; 'some of the words

'Nothing WHATEVER?' persisted the King.
'Nothing whatever,' said Alice.
'Nothing,' said Alice.
'Now tell me, Pat, what's that in the window?'
'Now, I give you fair warning,' shouted the Queen, stamping on the
'Of course it is,' said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree to
'Of course it was,' said the Mock Turtle.
'Of course not,' Alice replied very readily: 'but that's because it

'Of course,' the Dodo replied very gravely. 'What else have you got in
'Of course,' the Mock Turtle said: 'advance twice, set to partners--'
'Of the mushroom,' said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it
'Off with her head!' the Queen shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody
'Off with his head!' she said, without even looking round.
'Off with their heads!' and the procession moved on, three of the

'Oh, I beg your pardon!' cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt

'Only mustard isn't a bird,' Alice remarked.
'Pepper, mostly,' said the cook.
'Perhaps it doesn't understand English,' thought Alice; 'I daresay it's

'Perhaps not,' Alice cautiously replied: 'but I know I have to beat time

'So you did, old fellow!' said the others.

'Sure, it does, yer honour: but it's an arm for all that.'
'Sure, it's an arm, yer honour!' (He pronounced it 'arrum.')
'Swim after them!' screamed the Gryphon.
'THAT generally takes some time,' interrupted the Gryphon.
'THAT you won't' thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied
'Take off your hat,' the King said to the Hatter.
'Take some more tea,' the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.

'That WAS a narrow escape!' said Alice, a good deal frightened at the

'That is not said right,' said the Caterpillar.

'Then it ought to be Number One,' said Alice.
'Then it wasn't very civil of you to offer it,' said Alice angrily.
'Then the Dormouse shall!' they both cried. 'Wake up, Dormouse!' And
'Then the words don't FIT you,' said the King, looking round the court
'Then you keep moving round, I suppose?' said Alice.
'Then you may SIT down,' the King replied.
'Then you should say what you mean,' the March Hare went on.
'Then you shouldn't talk,' said the Hatter.
'Then, you know,' the Mock Turtle went on, 'you throw the--'
'There isn't any,' said the March Hare.
'There might be some sense in your knocking,' the Footman went on
